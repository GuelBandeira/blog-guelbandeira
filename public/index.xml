      <description>What tool did I use? This blog runs at no cost, with no database and on a free host. I created it without spending any money, in a very simple way that you can follow too. The only tool I used is called Hugo, a Go framework designed to build static websites. All you need to do is follow the documentation on their website, which is very easy to understand. It’s so straightforward that I found it unnecessary to extend this section further, you can replicate everything I did by simply following their instructions.</description>
