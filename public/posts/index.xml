      <description>What tool did I use? This blog runs at no cost, with no database and on a free host. The only cost I had was the domain name, for $10, but I already had that domain for my portfolio. For the blog itself this runs without any money from my pockets, and the tool I used is called Hugo, a Go framework designed to build static websites. All you need to do is follow the documentation on their website, which is very easy to understand.</description>
