## What tool did I use?

This blog runs at no cost, with no database and on a free host. I created it without spending any money, in a very simple way that you can follow too. The only tool I used is called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Go framework designed to build static websites. All you need to do is follow the documentation on their website, which is very easy to understand. It’s so straightforward that I found it unnecessary to extend this section further, you can replicate everything I did by simply following their instructions.

I chose the theme [Poison](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/), which I found the most pleasant, but you can choose the one that best suits you. One thing to keep in mind is that some themes, like [Hugo Blox](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blox-tailwind/), are built in modular blocks for you to assemble. These themes require extra attention because you will need to read their specific documentation.

## Which host did I pick?

This website is static, which means it doesn’t require any type of database, therefore, choosing a host becomes even simpler, since many platforms offer free hosting for static pages. Off the top of my head, I can mention Vercel, Netlify, and the well-known GitHub Pages, which is what I’m using for this blog.

## Conclusion

This is how I created a blog that runs without any costs. Today, there are other tools you can use to achieve the same results, such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which has the same purpose of generating static websites. In the end, it’s mostly about choosing the tool you find most user-friendly or the one you enjoy using the most.
